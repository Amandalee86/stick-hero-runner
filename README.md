# Stich Hero Runner

In my first ever project, I've created a program to play the game called Stick Hero(mobile). 
For this project to work, you will need to install 

  * Pure-Python-ADB
  * Numpy
  * PIL
  
I created this project inorder to process the image from the mobile, and give the command back to the mobile, due to latency the commands are not accurate, but works to certain extent. 

>I've taken a score of 638.
